# Teams File Upload Bot

Bot Framework v4 file upload bot sample for Teams.

This bot has been created using [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com), it shows how to
upload files to Teams from a bot and how to receive a file sent to a bot as an attachment. It also shows how to fetch inline images sent in message.

- **Interaction with bot**

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http --host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

## Setup for bot

In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration).
    - For bot handle, make up a name.
    - Select "Use existing app registration" (Create the app registration in Azure Active Directory beforehand.)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ create an [Azure free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)
    
   In the new Azure Bot resource in the Portal, 
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - In Settings/Configuration/Messaging endpoint, enter the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages`

## Setup for code
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

1) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/bot-file-upload/nodejs`

1) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

1) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.) `MicrosoftAppTenantId` will be the id for the tenant where application is registered.
- Also, set MicrosoftAppType in the `.env`. (**Allowed values are: MultiTenant(default), SingleTenant, UserAssignedMSI**)

1) Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (In Teams Apps/Manage your apps click "Upload an app". Browse to and Open the .zip file. At the next dialog, click the Add button.)
    - Add the app to personal scope (Supported app scope)

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-file-upload/nodejs/index.js#L46) line and put your debugger for local debug.

## Running the sample

> Note this `manifest.json` specified that the bot will be installed in "personal" scope which is why you immediately entered a one on one chat conversation with the bot. Please refer to Teams documentation for more details.

1. Adding the bot:
![add-App ](Images/add-App.png)

1. Sending a message to the bot will cause it to respond with a card that will prompt you to upload a file. The file that's being uploaded is the `teams-logo.png` in the `Files` directory in this sample. The `Accept` and `Decline` events illustrated in this sample are specific to Teams. You can message the bot again to receive another prompt.

1. You can send a file to the bot as an attachment in the message compose section in Teams. This will be delivered to the bot as a Message Activity and the code in this sample fetches and saves the file.
![attachment-File-Upload ](Images/attachment-File-Upload.png)
![attachment-File-Uploaded ](Images/attachment-File-Uploaded.png)

1. You can also send an inline image in the message compose section. This will be present in the attachments of the Activity and requires the Bot's access token to fetch the image.
